This is Safety Band Host deployment file

**Abstract**

As per the survey of World Health Organization (WHO) on violence against women they 
indicate, globally about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have either physical or sexual 
abuse in their lifetime. Harassment can negatively affect women’s physical, mental and 
sexual conditions. Many countries proposed various laws for the welfare of women 
safety. But still, each year it is being increasing day-by-day due to lack of help for a 
woman during the emergency situation (Who.int, 2019). The main aim of the proposed 
research work is to create a wearable Safety Band which sends alert notification to the 
emergency contact numbers as well as the emergency alert message (TWILIO) with real time 
location will be send to the people within certain distance who uses the same band. These 
Band users will be filtered out by a filter algorithm and sends the message via **Twilio**
SMS API which runs on the cloud for sending the SMS to the trustee users within victim 
location. All the above module will be working with the help of Wi-Fi data from the 
mobile. In case, if the women in emergency where there is no mobile network coverage,
they can’t send the emergency alert to anyone. So, we have come up with an idea by using 
the SIGFOX module. SIGFOX has a good coverage all over the EU countries and also 
being expanded all over the world. So, when the women clicks the button where there is 
no network coverage, SIGFOX will be activated for passing the real time Geolocation to 
the people in their emergency contact and nearby people using the same brand band by 
filtering algorithm.
